## Can I play on Console?
No, R5Reloaded is PC only. Additionally, you cannot invite your console friends to an R5Reloaded lobby.

## Can I use in game cosmetics?
No, In-game cosmetics are disabled and will stay disabled. If you want in-game cosmetics you should support Respawn by buying them.

## Can I use my Season 10 Apex files?
Under absolutely no circumstances should you attempt to run this with Season 10 Apex files. Doing this won't work, Easy Anti-Cheat will block it or may even ban you! Don't even try it. We only support the Season 3 Apex build files with the build string `R5pc_r5launch_N1094_CL456479_2019_10_30_05_20_PM`.

## What can I do with this project?
You can create your own lobbies to play solo or with your friends. There is also a server browser so you can eaisly find public servers.

## How do you properly host servers?
See: [Hosting a Server](servers/hosting)

## Why are some characters unavailable?
Some characters don't work completely at the moment. For example Caustic in the in-dev version uses the Electric Smoke grenade from Titanfall 2 for his ultimate to work.

## Can I play solos-duos?
Yes! That's up to you. You could even have 20 players in 1 squad.
<br>See: [Hosting a server](servers/hosting)</br>

## Can I play new Apex maps?
No, Current playable map list:
- Kings Canyon Season 0
- Kings Canyon Season 2
- Kings Canyon After Dark
- World's Edge
- World's Edge After Dark

We are unable to load new maps at the moment, subject to change.

## What are the ban risks?
We don't have a definitive answer but our project doesn't interfere with the apex official servers aside from using your origin account to retrieve the ingame name. Proceed at your own risk.

We suggest not using your main account for this. You need an origin account with Apex Legends in the library. We also suggest to turn off Auto-Update.

## Are there bugs?
There is shit-ton of bugs still persisting YOU WILL CRASH GURANTEED. You can follow our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ymr4R3j9/apexmod-s3n1094) page for tracking what bugs have been reported and fixed at this time.

## Can I contribute?
Everyone can, please open pull requests and issues on our github projects we would love any help we could get!

## Can I play alone on a server?
Yes you can, and even disable the ring to practice certain maps.
<br>See: [Hosting a server](servers/hosting)</br>

## Why do I crash when connecting to a Server?
Certain scenarios cause this.
Can you connect to your own local server?
Cool your build isn't corrupted that's already good.

Did you spam the Connect button like 2 times?
If yes this will also crash because the game does not expect that. If it doesn't work the first time wait till a prompt comes up with an error code from the game.

Did you try to connect and didn't close a prompt that came up giving you an error code?

Close it before trying to connect again else you will crash once again

Also only connect through main menu.
